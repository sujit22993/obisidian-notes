## Problem Statement
**Use Case**: ETL pipeline for public web data.
1. **Scraping** public websites → parsing → storing raw output in **Parquet** format on S3.
2. **Cleaning & Formatting** the data.
3. **Tagging** with predefined values (Name Tagging + Topic Tagging using regex rules or ML).
4. **Aggregation** using custom logic → store results in PostgreSQL tables.

When I say **ETL Scraping Tool**, I mean the above end-to-end pipeline.

## Solutions Considered

### Solution 1 – Microservices on ECS
- **Scraping**, **Cleaning & Tagging**, **Aggregation** as separate microservices.
- Deployed via GitHub Actions → ECR → ECS.
- AWS Lambda triggers ECS APIs when new data (PUT/POST) is detected in S3.
- Scraping service uses **multithreading** + **multiprocessing** to optimize time.

**Pros**:
- Full runtime control for scraping (libraries, browsers, proxies).
- Low-latency startup for scraping workloads.
- Easier to implement complex scraping logic (headless browsers, rate limiting).
- Flexibility in choosing language and dependencies.

**Cons**:
- Need to implement orchestration, retries, scaling manually.
- Not efficient for very large aggregations or shuffle-heavy workloads.
- Lambda→ECS cold start delays.
- Must handle backpressure and data quality checks yourself.

### Solution 2 – AWS Glue (Managed Spark)
 [[AWS Glue ETL - Detailed Notes]]
- Serverless Spark platform for large-scale data processing.
- Can handle cleaning, tagging, aggregation in distributed fashion.
- Integrates with **Glue Data Catalog** and S3 seamlessly.

**Pros**:
- No infrastructure management; pay-per-use.
- Handles large datasets, joins, aggregations efficiently.
- Schema evolution + automatic partitioning.
- Built-in retries, bookmarks, and lineage tracking.

**Cons**:
- Not suited for scraping (cold start, outbound networking limitations).
- Spark startup time (~2–3 min) adds overhead for small jobs.
- Cost can rise if jobs are over-provisioned or poorly tuned.

---

## Recommendation – Hybrid Approach
- **Scraping** in ECS (Fargate or EC2):
  - Optimized for I/O-bound operations, headless browsers, anti-bot bypass.
  - Writes raw Parquet or JSONL to S3 in partitioned structure.
- **ETL** in AWS Glue (PySpark):
  - Cleans, tags, aggregates data in parallel.
  - Writes cleaned/aggregated Parquet back to S3 or loads directly to PostgreSQL.

## Apache Spark for Cleaning & Tagging

### Why Spark is Appropriate
- **Data size**: Multiple GBs, Parquet format.
- **Transformation complexity**: CPU-intensive regex tagging + memory-heavy processing.
- Spark distributes workload across executors/nodes, overcoming single-machine memory/CPU limits.
- Native Parquet optimizations (predicate pushdown, column pruning).

### How Spark Distributes Tagging Work
1. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Parquet row groups are split into Spark **partitions**.
   - Each partition is assigned to a **task**.
2. **Executor Processing**:
   - Executors run tasks in parallel, each on a subset of rows.
   - Regex logic is sent to each executor.
3. **UDF/Pandas UDF**:
   - **UDF**: Row-wise processing in Python.
   - **Pandas UDF**: Vectorized batch processing using Arrow → much faster for regex-heavy workloads.
4. **Example**:
   
   ```python
import re
   from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
   from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

   pattern = re.compile(r"(apple|banana|orange)", re.IGNORECASE)

   @pandas_udf("string")
   def tag_series(col):
       return col.apply(lambda x: "fruit" if pattern.search(x) else "other")

   df = df.withColumn("tag", tag_series(df["text_column"]))
```

5. **Write Output**:

- Processed partitions are written back in parallel.
    
- Optimized for downstream use (Parquet partitioning).
