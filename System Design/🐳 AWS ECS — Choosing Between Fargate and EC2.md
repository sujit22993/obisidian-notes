### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ECS Launch Types

- **Fargate (Serverless containers)**
    
    - No servers to manage.
        
    - Pay per CPU & memory per second.
        
    - Good for **variable workloads** or when you don't want to manage infrastructure.
        
    - Auto-scales very quickly (no waiting for EC2 boot).
        
    - Limited in custom OS tweaks, GPUs, or exotic networking.
        
- **EC2 (Managed cluster)**
    
    - You provision and manage EC2 instances as container hosts.
        
    - More control over OS, networking, and instance types.
        
    - Cost-effective for **steady workloads** (can use Reserved/Spot instances).
        
    - Need to handle patching, scaling, and capacity management.
        

**üí° Rule of Thumb:**

- **Use Fargate** when you want minimal ops overhead and are okay with slightly higher per-unit cost.
    
- **Use EC2** when workloads are predictable, require custom setups, or need to be cost-optimized.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ECS vs. Plain EC2 + Docker

#### **Plain EC2 + Docker**

- You manually:
    
    - Create EC2 instances.
    - Install Docker.
    - Deploy containers yourself (via scripts, Ansible, etc.).
        
- **Pros**:
    - Absolute flexibility.
    - No AWS ECS dependency.
        
- **Cons**:
    - No built-in health checks, scaling, or container orchestration.
    - Manual deployments are error-prone.
        

#### **ECS on EC2**

- You still run on EC2, **but ECS orchestrates containers**.
    
- ECS handles:
    
    - Keeping the desired number of tasks running.
        
    - Auto-restarting failed containers.
        
    - Integrating with **ALB/NLB** for load balancing.
        
    - Blue/Green deployments via CodeDeploy.
        
- Scaling:
    
    - Scale **tasks** within current EC2 capacity.
        
    - Scale **EC2 nodes** via Auto Scaling Groups.
        
- **Pros**:
    
    - Less operational overhead vs. plain EC2 + Docker.
        
    - Built-in integration with AWS ecosystem.
        
- **Cons**:
    
    - Still need to manage EC2 lifecycle.
