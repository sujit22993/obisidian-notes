### **1. Overview**

AWS Glue is a **fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** service by AWS, built on top of **Apache Spark**. It automates:

- Data discovery (via crawlers)
    
- Schema management (via Data Catalog)
    
- Data transformation & loading (via Glue Jobs)
    
- Job orchestration (via triggers & workflows)
    

Glue is **serverless** → no cluster provisioning, scales automatically.

### **2. AWS Glue Data Catalog**

- Central metadata repository for all datasets processed by Glue.
    
- Stores:
    
    - Database definitions
        
    - Table schemas
        
    - Partitions
        
    - Job bookmarks (for incremental processing)
        
- Accessible by other AWS services (Athena, Redshift Spectrum, EMR, etc.).
    

---

### **3. Glue Database**

- A **logical grouping** of tables within the Data Catalog.
    
- Does **not** store the actual data → just metadata.
    
- Example:
    
    - Database: `scraped_data`
        
    - Tables: `raw_data`, `cleaned_data`, `tagged_data`
        

---

### **4. Glue Tables**

- Each table represents metadata for a dataset:
    
    - Location in S3
        
    - File format (Parquet, CSV, JSON, etc.)
        
    - Schema (column names, types)
        
    - Partition keys (if any)
        
- Tables can be created manually or via crawlers.
    

---

### **5. Crawlers**

- AWS Glue Crawlers **scan data in S3 or JDBC sources** to infer schema.
    
- They automatically:
    
    - Detect data format
        
    - Extract schema
        
    - Update Data Catalog
        
- Support incremental schema updates.
    
- Schedule: On-demand or periodic.
    

---

### **6. Connections**

- Store credentials & connection details for:
    
    - JDBC databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
        
    - Other AWS services
        
- Allows Glue Jobs to securely read/write data outside S3.
    

---

### **7. Glue ETL Jobs**

- Transformation scripts (PySpark/Scala) executed in a **managed Apache Spark environment**.
    
- Can be written in:
    
    - **Python (PySpark)** – recommended for ease
        
    - Scala (Spark)
        
- Supports:
    
    - Reading from multiple sources (S3, RDS, DynamoDB)
        
    - Complex transformations (joins, aggregations, regex tagging)
        
    - Writing back to S3, Redshift, RDS, etc.
        
- **Job Bookmark**: Keeps track of processed data for incremental ETL.
    

---

### **8. Glue Triggers**

- Orchestrates Glue Jobs:
    
    - **Event-based** (e.g., new file in S3)
        
    - **Schedule-based** (CRON expressions)
        
    - **On-job-completion** (chaining jobs)
        
- Enables building **ETL pipelines**.

## **Glue & Multithreading / Multiprocessing**

- AWS Glue jobs **run on Apache Spark**, which already provides **distributed parallel processing**.
    
- **Native multithreading/multiprocessing in Python** (e.g., `threading`, `multiprocessing` modules) is **not effective** inside Glue because:
    
    - Glue job runs in a distributed cluster → each executor handles its own partition.
        
    - Python threads don’t help Spark executors (due to GIL in Python), and multiprocessing doesn’t spread across nodes (only within executor’s memory).
        
- **How Glue handles parallelism:**
    
    - Spark automatically **splits large datasets into partitions** and processes them in parallel across executors.
        
    - The **number of DPUs** (Data Processing Units) defines available compute capacity.
        
    - Increase `--conf spark.executor.instances` and `--conf spark.executor.cores` for more parallelism.

### **When to Use Apache Spark in Glue**

- When:
    
    - Dataset size → **GBs to TBs**
        
    - CPU-heavy transformations (regex tagging, aggregation)
        
    - Need for distributed computing (millions of rows)
        
- Spark excels because:
    
    - Distributes data across **multiple nodes**
        
    - Executes transformations in parallel partitions
        
    - Minimizes shuffle (data movement) for efficiency
        

---

### **Glue Cost Model**

- Billed **per DPU-hour**, minimum 1-minute billing.
    
- 1 DPU = **4 vCPU + 16 GB RAM**
    
- Example: If job needs 10 DPUs for 30 minutes → you pay for 5 DPU-hours.
    

---

### **Example – Distributed Tagging with Glue**

1. Read millions of rows from S3 (Parquet)
    
2. Spark partitions data → each executor gets a subset
    
3. Apply **UDF (User Defined Function)** for tagging based on regex over specific columns
    
4. Each executor processes its partition **in parallel**
    
5. Results are combined and written back to S3 or PostgreSQL

### **Key Bottlenecks & Tips**

- **Bottleneck:** Large regex tagging on huge datasets → CPU-bound
    
    - Solution: Optimize regex, use Spark’s `broadcast` for lookup tables, cache intermediate results.
        
- **Bottleneck:** Data shuffle between executors
    
    - Solution: Partition data wisely (e.g., by key).
        
- **Bottleneck:** Memory spills
    
    - Solution: Increase DPUs, use `--conf spark.memory.fraction` tuning.
