## üìù **Concurrency & Parallelism in Python ‚Äì Quick Revision Notes**

---

### **Core Concepts**

1. **Multitasking** ‚Üí Running multiple tasks ‚Äúat the same time‚Äù from a user‚Äôs perspective.
    
2. **Concurrency** ‚Üí Structuring tasks so they can make progress together (may be parallel, may not).
    
3. **Parallelism** ‚Üí Actually running tasks at the same time on different CPU cores.
    
4. **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** ‚Üí In CPython, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at once.

### **Execution Models**

|Model|Use Case|Parallel?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Threads**|I/O-bound (blocking libs)|‚ùå (in Python)|OS threads, GIL prevents CPU parallelism|
|**Processes**|CPU-bound|‚úÖ|Separate memory space, no GIL interference|
|**Asyncio**|I/O-bound (async libs)|‚ùå|Single-threaded, cooperative multitasking|

---

### **Scheduling Types**

- **Preemptive** ‚Üí OS decides when to switch tasks (threads, processes).
    
- **Cooperative** ‚Üí Tasks yield control voluntarily (`await` in asyncio).
    

---

### **Context Switching**

- **Threads/Processes** ‚Üí OS saves/restores CPU registers, memory maps (expensive).
    
- **Asyncio** ‚Üí Just saves/restores Python stack frames & variables (cheap).

### **Choosing the Right Tool**

1. **Is task CPU-bound?**
    
    - ‚úÖ ‚Üí Use **multiprocessing**
        
    - ‚ùå ‚Üí Continue
        
2. **Is it I/O-bound with async-friendly libs?**
    
    - ‚úÖ ‚Üí Use **asyncio**
        
    - ‚ùå ‚Üí Use **threads**
        

---

### **Bridging Blocking and Async**

- `loop.run_in_executor()` ‚Üí Runs blocking code in a thread or process without freezing the async loop.
    
- Good for combining async I/O with existing synchronous libraries.
    

---

### **Best Practices (Modern)**

- Prefer **asyncio** for high-concurrency I/O workloads.
    
- Use **processes** for CPU-bound workloads.
    
- Only use **threads** when stuck with blocking I/O libraries.
    
- Avoid mixing models unless necessary ‚Äî complexity increases quickly.
    

---

### **Quick Analogies**

- **Threads** ‚Üí Multiple people sharing one kitchen, waiting turns for the stove.
    
- **Processes** ‚Üí Each person has their own kitchen.
    
- **Asyncio** ‚Üí One cook juggling many dishes, only working on one at a time while others are waiting.

## When to Choose Threads, Processes, or Asyncio in Real-World Systems**

Think of this step as ‚Äúthe decision-making framework‚Äù ‚Äî how modern Python developers choose the right concurrency tool.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Threads**

- **Best for:** I/O-bound work with blocking libraries (e.g., `requests`, file reads, DB drivers without async support).
    
- **Why:** While GIL prevents true parallel CPU work, threads can run I/O-bound code concurrently by releasing the GIL during I/O waits.
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Easy to add to existing code
        
    - Works with synchronous libraries
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Overhead from OS threads
        
    - Shared memory risks (race conditions)
        
    - Still limited to 1 CPU core for Python bytecode execution (due to GIL)
        

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Processes**

- **Best for:** CPU-bound work that needs multiple cores (e.g., image processing, machine learning preprocessing, simulations).
    
- **Why:** Each process has its own Python interpreter & GIL, so they run truly in parallel.
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Bypasses GIL
        
    - Scales with CPU cores
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Higher startup cost
        
    - Data must be serialized between processes (pickle overhead)
        
    - More memory usage
        

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Asyncio**

- **Best for:** High-concurrency I/O-bound tasks with async-friendly libraries (e.g., web scraping with `aiohttp`, async DB with `asyncpg`).
    
- **Why:** Single-threaded, cooperative multitasking using an event loop ‚Äî avoids thread/process overhead for massive numbers of concurrent I/O tasks.
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Extremely lightweight concurrency
        
    - Scales to thousands of tasks
        
    - Deterministic (no race conditions unless you use shared state badly)
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Blocking calls freeze the loop unless offloaded (`run_in_executor`)
        
    - Requires async-compatible libraries
        
    - Steeper learning curve
